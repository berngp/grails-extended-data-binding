Fork of the grails-extended-data-binding plugin hosted at http://svn.codehaus.org/grails-plugins/grails-extended-data-binding.  
As per its original description the extended data binding plugin allows configuring the DataBinder which controllers will 
use to parse the user input and populate objects, as well as wrapping objects to format data as strings in order to display data.
